# Reflection on Project Experience
## Project Approach:
I began by thoroughly trying to understand the purpose and scope of the project. Once I had a grasp of the overall objectives, 
I figured out how to approach the problem step by step. My initial research involved googling Morse code to understand how each alphabet and number is represented. 
This foundational knowledge was crucial as it informed the rest of the project. 
I then broke down the program into smaller modules, which helped me identify the essential programming concepts I needed to grasp to complete the project.

## Challenges Encountered:
#### Understanding Morse Code:
It took me some time to fully comprehend how Morse code works. 
I had questions like, "Does every letter have a static code?" and "How are spaces and other symbols represented in Morse code?" 
Addressing these questions was a necessary step before moving forward.

#### Programming Fundamentals: 
I initially struggled with some programming basics, particularly with dictionaries and how to access key-value pairs using loops. 
This was a hurdle, but breaking down the project into smaller parts made it more manageable.
#### Debugging: 
Although the project requirements were straightforward, I encountered a learning curve when it came to debugging. 
Learning how to use PyCharm's debugging tools was an added challenge but ultimately a valuable experience.

## Easier Aspects:
#### Project Scope: 
The project’s scope and requirements were clear and straightforward, which made the initial planning and execution relatively easy. 
The errors I encountered were also easy to identify and fix once I understood the debugging process.

## Areas for Improvement:
#### Project Planning and Time Management: 
I need to improve my project planning, especially in terms of time management and accurately estimating the time required for each task.
#### Code Commenting: 
I should focus more on adding comments throughout the program. 
Proper commenting will not only help in understanding the code later but also improve documentation.

Biggest Learning from the Project:
The most significant learning from this project was understanding how to approach a problem systematically and accurately interpret the project requirements. This experience reinforced the importance of a structured approach to problem-solving.

## What Would I Do Differently:

#### Prototype Development: 
If I were to tackle this project again, I would start by developing a small prototype. 
For instance, creating a dictionary and practicing how to access its key-value pairs would have provided a clearer understanding before diving into the main project.
#### Improved Commenting and Documentation: 
I would also put more effort into commenting and documenting the code as I go, which would make the project easier to understand and maintain.

This project was a valuable learning experience that highlighted both my strengths and areas where I can improve. 
Moving forward, I’ll apply these insights to enhance my approach to future projects.
